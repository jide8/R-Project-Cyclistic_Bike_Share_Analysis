## Set Working directory to local

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/jideo/OneDrive/Documents/dataCapstoneProject/csvFiles")
```

## install and load required packages 

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('skimr')
install.packages('janitor') # helps expedite the initial data exploration and cleaning 
library(tidyverse) # for data import and data wrangling
library(dplyr) # helps manipulate our data (creating new columns)
library(lubridate) # for date functions
library(skimr) #helps get quick summary of data
library(ggplot2) #helps to visualize data
library(readr)
```

#=====================
# STEP 1: COLLECT DATA
#=====================

# Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here

```{r}
q1_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv")
q1_2020<- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
```

#====================================================
# STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE
#====================================================

#Compare Column names of each file and Check for Column consistency
#I do this because column names DO need to match perfectly before we can use a command to join them into one file

```{r}
colnames(q1_2019)
colnames(q1_2020)
```
# Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies
```{r}
str(q1_2019)
str(q1_2020)
```
# Rename columns to make them consistent with q1_2020
```{r}
q1_2019 <- rename(q1_2019,
                  ride_id = trip_id,
                  rideable_type = bikeid,

                  ended_at = end_time,
                  start_station_name = from_station_name,
                  start_station_id = from_station_id,
                  end_station_name = to_station_name,
                  end_station_id = to_station_id,
                  member_casual = usertype
)
```
# Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies
```{r}
str(q1_2019)
str(q1_2020)
```
# Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly
```{r}
q1_2019 <- mutate(q1_2019,
                  ride_id = as.character(ride_id),
                  rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type))
```
# Stack individual quarter's data frames into one big data frame
```{r}
all_trips <- bind_rows(q1_2019, q1_2020)
```
# Remove lat, long, birthyear, and gender fields as this data was dropped beginning in 2020
```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, birthyear, gender, "tripduration"))
```
#======================================================
# STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS
#======================================================
# Inspect the new table that has been created
```{r}
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.
tail(all_trips) #see the last 6 rows of data frame
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics
```
# Reassign to the desired values (we will go with the current 2020 labels)
```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual,
                                "Subscriber" = "member",
                                "Customer" = "casual"))
```
# Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
#This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year.Before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level
```{r}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at)
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")
```
# Add a "ride_length" calculated columns to all_trips dataframe (in seconds)
```{r}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)
```
# Check the table with the new columns
```{r}
str(all_trips)
head(all_trips)
```
# Convert "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data
```{r}
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
```
# Remove "bad" data
# The dataframe includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative
```{r}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length < 0),]
```
#=====================================
# STEP 4: CONDUCT DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
#=====================================
```{r}

min(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #shortest ride
```
# Compare members and casual users
```{r}

```
# See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week,
FUN = mean)
```
# Notice that the days of the week are out of order. Let's fix that.
```{r}
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday",
"Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```
# analyze ridership data by type and weekday
```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarise(
    number_of_rides = n(),
    average_duration = mean(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE)

  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +

```
#=================================================
# STEP 5: EXPORT SUMMARY FILE FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
#=================================================
```{r}
counts <- aggregate(ride_length ~ member_casual + day_of_week, data = all_trips_v2, FUN = mean)
# Check if counts is created
print(counts)
write.csv(counts, file = 'avg_ride_length.csv')
